<caption>Current version hosted on GitHub</caption>

## Current Stage
- Title page
- Create shirushi page
- View map page (<a href="https://leafletjs.com/reference.html">leaflet</a>)
- Shirushi are placed at a random positon within a 500 meter radius of the user.

## To Be Added
- User sign up
- Change DB to have the following columns: user (name), premium (bool), marker (list of objects(creation date, colour, shape, message)), age (int or null), gender (char(m,f,o) or null)
- Change markers to save as objects linked to users.
- Add API for leaflet map (needed for non-local running)
